Problem Statement-Organizing events, whether they're conferences, weddings, or corporate gatherings, involves numerous tasks such as venue selection, attendee registration, agenda planning, and logistics coordination. Traditional methods of managing events through spreadsheets or manual processes can be inefficient and error-prone. Your task is to develop an event management website that streamlines the entire event planning process, from initial setup to post-event evaluation, providing organizers with the tools they need to plan, promote, and execute successful events seamlessly.
Plan of our project -

1. Homepage: Introduce your website and its services, featuring upcoming events and highlights.

2. Event Listings: Allow users to browse through a variety of events, filterable by date, location, category, etc.

3. Event Details: Provide comprehensive information about each event, including date, time, venue, description, and ticketing options.

4. User Registration/Login: Enable users to create accounts, save favorite events, and manage their bookings.

5. Feedback and Reviews: Allow attendees to leave feedback and ratings for events they've attended, helping others make informed decisions.
6. Email Notifications: Send confirmation emails for ticket purchases, event reminders, and updates to registered users.
